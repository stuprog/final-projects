our project is a full stack application that we created using react js, node js and mongoDB

We did the work as follow:

lina Barkaoui: part 1 and 2

Sami chakroun: part 3 and 4

Mohab elfaraa: part 5

we've done most of the work in face to face meetings.

We've created a demo to show how our application works
